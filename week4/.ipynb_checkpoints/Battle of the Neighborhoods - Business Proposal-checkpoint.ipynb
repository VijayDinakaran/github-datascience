    "Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. \n",

    "Toronto is a major Canadian city along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. It's a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN Tower. Toronto also has many green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queen’s Park to 400-acre High Park and its trails, sports facilities and zoo.\n",
    "This means there is a huge opportunity to do business here and the market it highly competitive because it is highly developed and densely populated area. Any new person or a company who are interested in doing business there should understand and analyse the market carefully before venturing. \n",
    "The insights derived from the project will provide a good understanding of the market there which helps make strategic decision.\n"

    "A restaurant is a business which prepares and serves food and drink to customers in return for money, either paid before the meal, after the meal, or with an open account. The City of Toronto is famous for its excellent cuisine and India is one of them. In this project, I am assuming a hypothetical scenario where there might not be enough India restaurants around the Toronto Area. This project will provide good insights to business stake holders who might want to open a new Indian restaurant there."
